This is my first real program. Before this it was all terminal math and formatting 
stuff to learn programming. I know this is not anything special. It has bugs and you
cant really resize the frame. The code is sloppy and overly large. The art was hastily hand drawn in an hour haha. While I would do this very differently if I did it over again I keep it as a reminder of how far i've come.
